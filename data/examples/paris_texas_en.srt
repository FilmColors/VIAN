2
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,276
What the <i>hell?</i>

3
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:07,324
Hey!

4
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:15,824
<i>You know which side of the border
you're on?</i>

5
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,241
<i>You got a name, boy?</i>

6
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:25,748
Guess someone must have
cut your tongue off.

7
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,626
Either that, or —

8
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:37,297
you've got something to hide.

10
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,346
As far as I can tell —

11
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,682
you hear me <i>plain</i> enough!
Heh.

12
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,360
<i>"Walter Henderson."</i>

13
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,115
Now, I want to ask you
one last question.

14
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,992
You see this here card?

15
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,536
Is this you —
or a relative of yours?

17
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:25,630
Well — I'm going to call up this number,
and see if they can tell me who you <i>are!</i>

19
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,178
I ain't got beds enough
to be puttin' up mutes.

20
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:41,356
<i>Operator — I need a line out, please.</i>

21
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,413
Uh — <i>What?</i>

22
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:03,166
What? Can you — can you tell me
the exact location of your hospital, down there?

23
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,087
Where the hell is <i>that?</i>

24
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,340
Oh — okay, alright.

25
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:14,509
Yeah — okay.
I'll get there as fast as I can.

26
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:17,470
Just — will you tell him
that I'm coming, okay?

27
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:18,763
Okay.

30
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:31,524
Ann, honey?

31
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:35,403
I just got the <i>strangest</i> phone call.

32
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:36,821
Who from?

33
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:40,782
From some hospital in South Texas.
A place called <i>"Terlingua"</i> —

34
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:44,243
they say they found Travis.

35
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:45,869
Oh, <i>no.</i>

36
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,414
What are you going to do?

37
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,622
Well, I'll go down and get him.

38
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,040
Oh, wow —

39
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,793
Well, what am I gonna do?
I can't leave him down there.

40
00:07:58,297 --> 00:08:02,301
What about Hunter?
What am I supposed to tell him?

42
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:05,469
Well, just tell him
I had to go on a business trip.

43
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,555
I mean — about Travis.

44
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:18,398
I guess you'd better tell him the truth.

45
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,793
10 to Van Horn 90 —
then Alpine 118 South —

47
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,550
Terlingua.

48
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,036
You must be the brother of the mute.

49
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:26,248
Mute?

50
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:31,002
Yeah — I couldn't squeeze the 
time of day outta him!

51
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,005
Must be in a kind of jam!

52
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:39,301
I dunno — I haven't seen him
in over four years.

53
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:41,512
Is that right?

54
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:47,015
Well, a lot can happen
to a man in four years.

55
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:51,8951
All kinds of trouble —
bits of trouble.

57
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:53,397
What do you mean?

58
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:58,939
Well — down here —
a man gets himself into a fix, sometimes.


60
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:03,945
It costs him a little to get him out —
if you understand what I mean.

62
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,410
I <i>don't</i> understand you.

63
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:10,496
I wish you get to the point,
because I'd like to see my brother.

64
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:13,873
Alright, son.

65
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,127
But first —
I would like to ask you something.

66
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:22,257
Did your brother ever get himself
into a car wreck?

67
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:30,386
Car wreck — no —
not that I know of.

69
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:34,181
Then he must be mixing
with some <i>hard</i> company.

70
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:38,602
I'd like to see my brother now —
If you <i>don't</i> mind.

71
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:41,146
He disappeared!

72
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,232
You mean — he's not here?

73
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,651
After I came all this way?

74
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,904
He's been gone since
early this morning.

75
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:55,618
We have his possessions.
Nevertheless — saved them.

77
00:10:57,494 --> 00:11:04,499
We'd be glad to turn him over to you —
soon as you take care of our little reward.

79
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:43,377
Travis — hey —

80
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:50,425
Don't you recognize me? It's Walt!

81
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:00,183
It's your brother — Walt.

82
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:22,536
What the hell happened to you, anyway?
You look like forty miles of rough road.

84
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,381
Come on — let's get in the car — 
Trav?

85
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:37,759
C'mon.

86
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,641
Here, Trav — here's your stuff.

87
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,561
Got that back at that clinic,
back there.

88
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:43,313
Sure picked a hell of a spot to land in —
I don't blame you for running out of it.

90
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:54,533
Look, Trav —
we've got quite a bit of traveling to do here.

92
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:56,910
You're not gonna clam up
the whole way, are you?

93
00:14:57,953 --> 00:14:59,662
I'm going to get kinda <i>lonely.</i>

94
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:05,418
Trav?

95
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,215
Would you mind telling me where you disappeared to
or the last four years?

96
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,220
Have you seen Jane — or talked to her?

97
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:27,058
Ann and I —
we sorta gave up on you — we actually —

99
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,729
we thought you were <i>dead,</i> boy!

100
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,345
This is pretty, uh —

101
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:19,898
<i>Okay.</i>

102
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:29,741
Well —

103
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,913
Well, gee, Trav — maybe you wanna —
get cleaned up — take a shower or something?

105
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,546
I think I'll go back into town
and get you some new clothes.

106
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,379
You could use a new 
set of clothes, couldn't you?

107
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,050
What size shoes do you wear?

108
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,927
Let's see —

109
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,432
I'm probably one size bigger, huh?

110
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:03,645
Where'd you find that beard?

111
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:06,147
Pretty snazzy.

112
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,528
Okay —
I'll zip into town and zip right back.

113
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,365
I won't be gone long.

114
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:25,622
You'll be okay — won't you, Trav?

115
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,711
Yeah — I'll be right back.

116
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:24,183
<i>Dammit</i> —

117
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:25,236
Mind telling me where
you're headed, Trav?

118
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:30,950
What's out there?

119
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:39,541
Nothin' <i>out there.</i>

120
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:44,629
Don't you trust me or something?

121
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,468
I'm just trying to help you, Trav —
that's all.

122
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,182
C'mon — it's alright.

123
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,351
C'mon with me in the car.

124
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,952
Feels good to be in new clothes, huh?

125
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:36,641
Hi — Hunter? 
It's Daddy.

126
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,768
I thought you'd be in bed already!

127
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:44,816
Guess who I'm visiting 
here in Texas.

128
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:48,487
Your father!

129
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:50,906
You remember your father?

130
00:22:53,491 --> 00:22:54,492
Not at all?

131
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:58,912
He was?

132
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,165
Well — guess what?

133
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,792
I'm gonna bring him home to visit.

134
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,056
Travis —

135
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:28,562
Do you remember your little boy —
Hunter?

136
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:33,149
Well — he's with us.

137
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:37,319
He's been living with Ann and me,
ever since you disappeared.

138
00:23:39,238 --> 00:23:42,783
We didn't know what else to do —
so we just kept him.

140
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:47,620
One day, he was just standing at the door.

141
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:52,417
All he could tell us was that
someone brought him there in a car.

142
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,336
He didn't know what had happened to you —
or Jane —

144
00:23:57,671 --> 00:24:00,966
so we tried everything we could
think of to find you — or Jane —

145
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:03,969
tried to locate her — she'd vanished, too.

146
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,764
We didn't know what else to do.

147
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:17,519
Travis —
I dunno what kind of trouble you got into —

149
00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:20,316
I dunno what happened —

150
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:24,862
But <i>dammit</i> — I'm your <i>brother,</i> man.

151
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,031
You can talk to me.

152
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:34,411
I'm tired of doing all the taking.

153
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:18,908
Fill it with unleaded, please.

154
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,704
You know — I'm getting a little <i>sick</i>
of this silence routine.

155
00:25:25,747 --> 00:25:26,957
You can talk!

156
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:38,633
I can be silent too, y'know.

157
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:44,180
I just assume that both of us'll
keep our mouths shut for the whole rest of the trip —

158
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:45,057
<i>Paris.</i>

158
00:25:45,222 --> 00:25:46,557
What?

159
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:50,142
Paris.

160
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,108
Paris?

161
00:25:58,317 --> 00:25:59,318
<i>Paris?</i>

162
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:02,822
Did you ever go to Paris?

163
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:06,074
No?

164
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,743
Could we go there now?

165
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,123
It's a little outta the way.

166
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:21,377
No, I've never even been to Europe —
Ann keeps on wanting to go there —

168
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:24,257
well, she's <i>from</i> France — you remember?

169
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:29,507
But, we never seem to find the time,
'cause my company keeps me kinda busy.

171
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,941
Let's go, Trav.

172
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:50,404
What's the matter?

173
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:52,197
Where are we going?

174
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,905
We're gonna fly to L.A.

175
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,324
You're not afraid of flying, are you?

176
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,386
We're — leaving the ground?

176
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,786
Yeah.

177
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,080
Why?

178
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,206
Because it's too far to drive.

179
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,876
It would take an extra two days —
I can't afford the time, Trav.

180
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,377
<i>Why?</i>

181
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:13,800
It's just easier to fly, Trav.
It's faster. C'mon!

182
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:34,734
We'll get'cha home, okay?

183
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:38,155
When I get you home, I'll get you settled,
and then you can do whatever you want!

184
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:42,867
<i>But, sir — we can't stop the plane
every time someone gets terrified!</i>

185
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:45,827
Don't get on a plane, and then
refuse to leave the ground!

186
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:48,955
Don't do things like that!
This isn't the wilderness!

187
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:51,374
You're living with <i>people,</i> now!
<i>Okay?</i>

188
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:55,670
<i>You should have acquired a private plane —
do you realize how many people you're detaining?</i>

189
00:27:55,962 --> 00:27:57,129
Sorry!

190
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:59,924
I'm sorry — I'm sorry — I'm sorry —
okay?

191
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:05,302
This is getting a little <i>ridiculous,</i> Travis.

192
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:08,472
Are you going to leave me?

193
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:11,390
No, I'm not going to leave you.

194
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,685
It's alright if you leave me.

195
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:19,356
I don't know honey — no —
He just panicked or something.

196
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:25,776
Well — it won't do any good to try another plane —
it wasn't the plane — he'll just get off again!

198
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:29,532
Well — we're just gonna
have to drive it — that's all.

199
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,826
Yeah — it'll take a good two days.

200
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:39,123
I don't understand why you have to
have the very same car you had before!

201
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,791
They're all alike —

202
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:45,876
all the cars we have here are 'Birds,
Oldses, Chevys, and whatever —

204
00:28:45,905 --> 00:28:48,131
I'm not even sure I can locate the same car
you had before!

204
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:53,131
I know — my brother left something in the car —
we're hoping we can search the car and find it!

206
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:56,347
Oh — well, I'll just contact the 
Lost and Found Department for you if that's okay, sir —

207
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:58,432
No — we have to have the very same car.

208
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:01,809
Well — I can't do <i>that!</i>
There's no way I can trace that car for you.

209
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:04,770
Well, why not? 
You've got the license number right on your form, there!

210
00:29:04,854 --> 00:29:06,356
Well — yes, but —

210
00:29:05,854 --> 00:29:07,356
Well, just give us the license number
and <i>we'll</i> find it!

211
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,984
But I can't allow you on the lot, sir.

212
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:12,611
Why <i>not?</i> We're already on it!

213
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:15,530
I just have to ask you
to come back to the office with me.

214
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:20,077
Travis!

214
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,077
What?

215
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:24,456
I don't think we're gonna
get the very same car.

216
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:27,915
But I can rent you a model that's
just like the one you had before, sir.

217
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,086
I need the same car, Walt!
How are we gonna go in another <i>car?</i>

218
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:35,838
Give us the number — will ya, please?

219
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:38,715
Come on — pretty please?

220
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:44,304
Alright — that number is 667 DJP.

221
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,806
Remember that? 667 DJP?

222
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,035
It's got a bump on the hood —

222
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:49,435
Yes it does.

223
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,239
What's <i>that?</i>

224
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:07,532
What?

225
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:09,201
That — what you've got in your hand?

226
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:11,912
A picture.

227
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,704
A picture of what?

228
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:15,873
A picture of —

229
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,417
Paris.

230
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,962
Paris — really?

231
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:24,673
Yes — a picture of a <i>piece</i> of Paris.

232
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:26,967
Where'd you get a picture of Paris?

233
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:28,549
Can I see it?

233
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:29,053
Yes.

234
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,305
This is it?
This is Paris?

235
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:36,059
Looks just like Texas to me.

236
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:37,602
It <i>is.</i>

237
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:39,687
Paris, Texas?

238
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,731
It's right here on the map.

239
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,356
There's really a place called
Paris, Texas?

240
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:45,024
It's <i>right here!</i>

241
00:30:47,777 --> 00:30:50,696
Well — how come you've got a picture
of a vacant lot in Paris, Texas?

242
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:52,823
It's <i>mine!</i>

243
00:30:53,657 --> 00:30:55,992
I know that — but how come you got it?

244
00:30:56,868 --> 00:31:02,455
I purchased it — in the mail —
a long time ago.

246
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,752
You bought a picture
of vacant lot in the mail?

247
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:08,129
No — I bought the <i>land</i> —

248
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,354
Oh, you bought that lot!

248
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,754
Yes.

249
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:12,131
Lemme see it again.

250
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:16,468
There's nothing on it!

251
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:19,012
<i>Empty.</i>

252
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:23,932
Well — why in hell would you wanna buy
a vacant lot in Paris, Texas, for Christ's sake?

253
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:35,609
I forgot.

254
00:31:37,987 --> 00:31:38,863
Here, Trav.

255
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:49,621
Do you remember
what Mama's very first name was?

256
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:51,623
Mary.

257
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:56,754
No — I know — I mean her —
before she found Daddy.

258
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:58,962
Oh — her maiden name?

258
00:31:57,871 --> 00:31:58,962
Yeah.

259
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:01,841
You don't remember her maiden name?

260
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,426
No.

261
00:32:04,552 --> 00:32:05,720
Zaquine.

262
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:08,388
<i>Zaquine.</i>

263
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:09,848
Spanish.

264
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,640
Her <i>father</i> was.

265
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:13,309
Yeah?

266
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,608
I don't believe it!

267
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,778
You finally decided to <i>eat!</i>

268
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,738
<i>Eating</i> and <i>talking!</i>

269
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,824
Before you know it,
you'll be back in the land of the living!

270
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,496
You want me to drive?

271
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,582
Sure! Think you remember how?

272
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,834
My <i>body</i> remembers.

273
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,172
You can sleep while I drive.

274
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,383
Okay.

275
00:33:06,397 --> 00:33:10,856
Well, Trav —
think maybe you're ready to —

277
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:13,821
tell me what the hell happened to you
over the last four years?

278
00:33:16,446 --> 00:33:17,698
No — not yet.

279
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:54,938
<i>Travis?</i>

280
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:56,481
What?

281
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,583
Where are we, Travis?
What happened?

282
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:18,335
Why'd we get off the highway?

283
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:21,130
Jesus Christ.

284
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,881
I can't even sleep for five minutes
without some crisis.

285
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:25,549
Why'd you turn off?

286
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,304
I don't know where I turned off.
Didn't have a name.

287
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:35,974
That's <i>great.</i>

288
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:37,934
That's just damn great.

289
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:41,771
Here we are — in the middle of the Mojave Desert —
in a place that doesn't have a name!

290
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:46,317
I could find the highway again.

291
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,045
Trav — I need to talk to you a little bit
about Hunter.

292
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:12,589
How old is he now?

293
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:15,550
He's eight in January.

294
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:17,337
He's seven, then.

294
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:18,637
Yeah.

295
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:23,349
But, see — what I want to talk about is —

296
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:28,604
well — he's like part of the family, now.

297
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:32,733
Ann and me are like his parents now.

298
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:35,276
Ann's your wife.

299
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:37,237
Yeah — you remember her, don't you?

300
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:40,239
No. — does he think that you're his father?

301
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:46,078
Well — Ann told him you were coming.

302
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:49,789
Who does he think <i>I</i> am?

303
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,419
I told him you're his father.

304
00:35:55,336 --> 00:36:00,500
But — see —
you've been gone a <i>long</i> time, Trav.

306
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:02,841
How long have I been gone?
Do you know?

307
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:05,593
Four years.

308
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,305
Is four years a long time?

309
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:14,309
It <i>is</i> for a little boy.

310
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:17,353
That's half his life!

311
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:21,567
<i>Half a boy's life.</i>

312
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,737
I remember now —

313
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:28,572
What?

314
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:33,702
Why I bought that land.

315
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:35,411
Oh — why?

316
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:38,788
Well — Mama once told me that, uh —

317
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:43,666
that's where she and Daddy first —
made love.


319
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,046
Oh — in Paris, Texas?

320
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:48,507
Yeah.

320
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:49,507
She told you that?

321
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,507
Yeah.

322
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:59,347
So — I figured that —
that's where <i>I</i> began.

324
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,561
I mean me — Travis Clay Henderson —
they named me that.

325
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:07,522
I started out there.

326
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:11,194
Paris, Texas, huh?

326
00:37:11,274 --> 00:37:12,194
Yeah.

327
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:18,448
So you think —
maybe you were conceived there?

328
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:21,076
Yeah.

329
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,870
You could be right, Travis.

330
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:27,334
Daddy always had a joke about it.

331
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:29,877
What was the joke?

332
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:36,545
He would introduce Mama
as the girl he met in Paris.


334
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,133
And then he'd wait —

335
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:44,220
before he said Texas —
'til everybody thought that he meant —

336
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:49,115
he would wait before he said Texas,
'til everybody thought —

338
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:52,687
after everybody thought
that he was talking about Paris, <i>France.</i>

339
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,563
He always laughed real hard about it.

340
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,611
So you live in Los Angeles, huh?

341
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,114
Yeah — well, we live in the suburbs,
but I've got my business in town.

343
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,450
What's your business?

344
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:10,536
I make billboard signs —
for advertising.

345
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:12,830
Oh, yeah?

346
00:38:13,872 --> 00:38:16,542
So <i>you're</i> the one that makes all those —
I love those.

347
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,210
Some of 'em are beautiful.

348
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:20,877
I'm not the only one in the world
that makes 'em, Trav.

349
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:46,651
Trav? This way.

350
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,529
Nice, huh?
Just been in here three months.

351
00:38:50,904 --> 00:38:53,949
I really like it —
but I took a beating on the financing, I'll tell ya —

352
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,577
like everybody else nowadays,
I guess.

353
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,916
Hi, baby.

354
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:08,061
Everything okay here?

354
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:10,795
Oh, sure. We just missed you a lot.

356
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:12,255
I missed you, too.

357
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:14,383
Come in!


357
00:39:14,548 --> 00:39:15,383
Travis.

358
00:39:20,388 --> 00:39:21,723
My <i>god.</i>

359
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,017
We were beginning to wonder
if we'd ever see you again.

360
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,061
It's been so long.

361
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,022
Did you have a good trip?

362
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:32,940
Yeah — it was fine.

363
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:37,526
Hunter?

364
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:53,039
Hunter —
this is Travis.

366
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:08,388
Hi.

367
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:12,476
<i>Hi.</i>

368
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:26,028
I bet it was really hot
coming across the Mojave Desert.

369
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:30,407
Yes.

370
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:32,575
Too bad you had to drive.

371
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:35,036
What happened?

372
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:38,790
Well — Travis just didn't feel like flying.

373
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:41,166
Oh — I don't blame you.

374
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:43,418
I can't stand airplanes anymore.

375
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,336
Especially since we live in <i>this</i> house.

376
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:49,300
All we hear is planes, day in and day out —

377
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,467
I like them.

378
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:01,018
You used to fly — didn't you, Travis?

379
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,853
No.

380
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:16,150
Oh, I thought — I remember Jane
telling me that you once flew to Dallas together — or somewhere.

383
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:20,743
Maybe I'm mistaken.

384
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:46,554
Honey — he hasn't slept in a bed
since we started — I swear to God!

386
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,808
I don't think that's even necessary.

387
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:51,312
Where has he been sleeping, then?

388
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:53,898
Well — he doesn't <i>sleep!</i>

389
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,483
He has to sleep <i>somewhere.</i>

390
00:41:56,983 --> 00:42:00,984
Okay — but I don't think
he's even going to use it.

392
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:03,489
He's got to get tired some time!

393
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,160
Oh —
there is a towel for you, Travis —

394
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:13,080
and some underwear and socks, from Walt.

395
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:16,375
Goodnight.

396
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,626
Thank you.

397
00:42:24,464 --> 00:42:26,967
Okay. Get some shut-eye.

398
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:28,593
Okay.

399
00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:31,221
- Sweet dreams.
- Alright.

400
00:43:41,281 --> 00:43:42,782
You polished them!

401
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:47,495
That's very nice of you, Travis.

402
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:51,749
Would you like to come in
and have some breakfast?

403
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:55,417
Aren't you hungry?

404
00:43:57,044 --> 00:43:59,379
We are going to have strawberry waffles!

405
00:44:00,214 --> 00:44:01,424
Do you like them?

406
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:04,008
Do you want some?

407
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:17,771
Well — there is hot coffee on the stove,
if you want some.

408
00:44:20,815 --> 00:44:22,108
Look at that truck.

409
00:45:00,684 --> 00:45:01,810
Hi.

410
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:39,467
Decided to rough it, huh?

411
00:45:39,634 --> 00:45:40,635
Yeah.

412
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:43,555
What did you do — spit-shine these?

413
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:45,598
I can get you a job
at the airport doing that.

414
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:51,894
Hey — do you wanna trade these new boots
for those old boots?

415
00:45:53,021 --> 00:45:54,230
Yeah — you can wear 'em.

416
00:45:56,814 --> 00:45:57,898
Thank you.

417
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:30,053
Travis? I have to rush off
to get Hunter to school on time.

418
00:46:30,428 --> 00:46:32,221
We will be back this afternoon.

419
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:35,473
Walt's office number is
on the dining room table.

420
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:37,266
See you later!

421
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:39,394
Okay.

421
00:46:38,867 --> 00:46:39,894
Bye!

422
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:15,132
Ann?

422
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:15,632
Yeah?

423
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,928
I was just thinking —
maybe I can meet Hunter after school —

424
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:21,389
and we could walk home together —
if he wants to.

425
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,391
That sounds like a great idea, Travis.

426
00:47:26,392 --> 00:47:29,853
Walk home?
I don't <i>wanna</i> walk home, Mom.

427
00:47:31,188 --> 00:47:33,816
Nobody walks — everybody <i>drives.</i>

428
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:37,893
Come on, Hunter —
it won't hurt you to walk home once in your life!

430
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:40,155
No — no —
I don't want to.

431
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:44,200
Travis, I insist —
he'll wait for you out in front.

431
00:47:42,515 --> 00:47:44,200
Everybody'll <i>see</i> me!

431
00:47:44,515 --> 00:47:46,700
Walt can tell you how to get there —
it's not far —

432
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,832
and get into the car, Hunter —
we are late as it is.

433
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:56,044
You're <i>mean.</i>

434
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,643
Can I come with you?

434
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,643
Sure.

435
00:49:39,801 --> 00:49:42,095
I'm really sorry about this, Travis.

436
00:49:43,805 --> 00:49:45,680
It's not easy for him, Ann.

437
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,021
Ann, it's okay — he's in here.

438
00:50:03,655 --> 00:50:04,698
What are you doing?

439
00:50:05,282 --> 00:50:06,283
Driving.

440
00:50:07,325 --> 00:50:08,368
Where to?

441
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:10,953
Just driving.

442
00:50:11,954 --> 00:50:13,664
You're not hiding out in there, are you?

443
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:15,289
No.

444
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:23,503
Hunter —
Travis is your <i>real</i> dad —

445
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:24,546
you know that, don't you?

446
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:31,426
Dad? When are they gonna
make spaceships like they make cars?

448
00:50:33,805 --> 00:50:36,348
Hunter — I'm asking you a question.
Can you answer it?

449
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:38,517
<i>What?</i>

450
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:47,232
Well — Travis went to meet you at school —
and he wanted to walk you home.

452
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:49,694
Nobody walks.

453
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:52,237
That's not the point.

454
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:57,824
Travis is your real dad, and —
he wants to talk you.

456
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:02,622
<i>Why?</i> What <i>about?</i>

457
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:06,919
Okay — come on. Let's go have dinner.

458
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:22,933
Hey, Trav? Do you remember that time
when Ann and me came down to visit you — about five years ago?

459
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:27,019
No.

460
00:51:27,978 --> 00:51:30,146
You and Jane were down in Texas —
right there on the coast.

461
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:32,565
Hunter was about three.

462
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:34,901
Don't you remember that?

463
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:39,738
No.

464
00:51:39,947 --> 00:51:41,949
I remember — we went fishing.

465
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,284
Yeah.

466
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:47,871
I took some Super 8 on that trip —
and I put it all together.

467
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,579
Thought maybe you might
like to see some of it.

468
00:51:50,664 --> 00:51:51,790
What is it?

469
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:54,041
Movies. You know — Super 8?

470
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,418
Oh.


471
00:51:56,169 --> 00:51:59,129
Walt — maybe Travis doesn't want —

472
00:52:00,422 --> 00:52:01,340
What?

473
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:06,594
Well — maybe he'd like to wait a while
before he looks at it.

474
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,888
Yeah — it's up to him.

475
00:52:10,597 --> 00:52:12,225
Just maybe thought you'd
like to see some of it.

476
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,978
Movies? Sure.

477
00:52:15,228 --> 00:52:18,980
Great! There's some great stuff on it —
some great shots of Hunter in it.

478
00:52:19,939 --> 00:52:21,148
I've already seen it!

479
00:52:21,816 --> 00:52:22,900
Well, you have to see it again.

480
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,696
Come on — help me set up the projector.

480
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,696
Okay.

481
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:56,482
That's me driving!

482
00:53:57,191 --> 00:53:58,859
I know — you're gonna be good.

483
00:57:04,143 --> 00:57:05,855
Time for bed now, Hunter.

484
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:09,024
Oh, <i>Mom —</i>

485
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:11,359
Time to go to bed — it's past ten.

486
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:15,946
Goodnight, Dad.

486
00:57:13,861 --> 00:57:15,946
Goodnight, baby.

487
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:23,410
Goodnight, Dad.

488
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,710
Do you think he still loves her?

489
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:34,128
How would I know that, Hunter?

490
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:36,880
I think he does.

491
00:57:38,674 --> 00:57:39,800
How can you tell?

492
00:57:40,134 --> 00:57:41,927
Well — the way he looked at her.

493
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:44,221
You mean, when he saw her in the movie?

494
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:47,349
Yeah — but that's not her.

495
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:49,142
What do you mean?

496
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:55,795
That's only her in a movie —
a long time ago —

498
00:57:57,108 --> 00:57:59,402
in a galaxy far, far away.

499
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:38,352
What are you looking for?

500
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:43,486
I'm looking for — uh —
<i>the</i> father.

502
00:58:43,856 --> 00:58:44,816
<i>Your</i> father?

503
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:48,151
No, no — just a father —
any father.

504
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:50,111
What does a father look like?

505
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:52,822
There are many different kinds of fathers,
<i>Señor Travis.</i>

506
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,616
Well — I just need <i>one.</i>

507
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,243
You think you're gonna
find him in there?

508
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,078
Well — I don't know where else to look.

509
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,414
Oh, I see — <i>you</i> want to look like a father.

510
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:04,791
Yeah.

511
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,169
Tell me — do you want to be a <i>rich</i> father?

512
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:12,130
Uh — no.

513
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:14,049
A poor one?

513
00:59:15,422 --> 00:59:14,049
No.

514
00:59:15,467 --> 00:59:16,636
Then, which?

515
00:59:17,051 --> 00:59:17,969
In-between.

516
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:20,555
No — no — there <i>is</i> no in-between, eh?

517
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:22,932
You either have to be a <i>rich</i> father
or a <i>poor</i> one.

518
00:59:23,307 --> 00:59:24,600
Rich.

518
00:59:25,307 --> 00:59:26,600
<i>Bueno. Un momento.
Ta bien.</i>

518
00:59:28,307 --> 00:59:30,600
<i>Ahora sí.</i> Okay.

518
00:59:31,307 --> 00:59:33,600
<i>A ver —</i> huh?

518
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:39,600
<i>¿Qué tal?</i> Eh?

518
00:59:39,307 --> 00:59:40,600
<i>Está bueno.</i>

519
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:42,657
Okay —
one thing you must remember —

520
00:59:42,907 --> 00:59:48,659
to be a rich father, <i>Señor Travis,</i>
you must look to the sky — and never at the ground.

522
00:59:50,414 --> 00:59:51,623
Little higher.

522
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:53,623
<i>Eso.</i> Mmm-<i>hmm</i>.


522
00:59:53,814 --> 00:59:55,623
<i>Ahora camina.</i>

523
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:02,048
No — <i>este</i> —

524
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,842
You must walk <i>stiff,</i> 
<i>Señor Travis.</i>

524
01:00:08,966 --> 01:00:10,840
<i>Con confianza — ¿me entiende?</i>

524
01:00:010,966 --> 01:00:12,840
Um — <i>con respeto.</i>

525
01:00:14,392 --> 01:00:15,643
<i>Dignity.</i>

525
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:16,643
<i>Eso! Con ¡dignidad!</i>

526
01:00:32,493 --> 01:00:33,700
You <i>got</i> it.

527
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:56,263
Who is that guy — you know him?

528
01:00:57,264 --> 01:00:59,307
Yeah — he's my father's brother.

529
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:06,230
No — they're both brothers.

530
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:09,566
No — they're both <i>fathers.</i>

531
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,860
No — ah, forget it.

532
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:15,656
But both <i>whose</i> fathers?

532
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:16,656
<i>My</i> father.

533
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,325
How can you have two fathers?

534
01:01:19,492 --> 01:01:21,033
Just lucky, I guess.

535
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:23,685
Well, bye!

535
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:24,285
Bye.

536
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,134
That's my dad's suit!

537
01:03:20,053 --> 01:03:21,262
I mean — Walt.

538
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:23,515
That's okay if you call him <i>"Dad."</i>

539
01:03:24,682 --> 01:03:27,352
Yeah — I borrowed it from him.
He said it was okay.

540
01:03:33,107 --> 01:03:34,565
What are those pictures?

541
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:36,859
That's <i>my</i> dad —

542
01:03:38,612 --> 01:03:40,030
your grandfather.

543
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:45,117
What was his name?

544
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:47,202
Travis.

545
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:48,912
Same as yours?

546
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:51,498
Where is he, now?

547
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:54,500
He died.

548
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:59,337
Couple of years after this picture —
in that car.

550
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,331
Oh. He's dead?

550
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:01,631
Mmm-hmm.

551
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:05,427
But, can you <i>feel</i> that he's dead?

552
01:04:06,136 --> 01:04:07,262
What do you mean?

553
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:11,513
You knew him
when he was walking around and talking — right?

554
01:04:11,638 --> 01:04:12,266
Yeah.

555
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,102
So can you feel that he's gone?

556
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,565
Yeah — sometimes.
I know he's dead.

557
01:04:21,982 --> 01:04:23,942
I never felt like you were dead.

558
01:04:24,276 --> 01:04:28,989
I could always feel you were walking
around and talking — someplace.

560
01:04:29,781 --> 01:04:31,448
I feel Mom, too.

561
01:04:32,031 --> 01:04:33,241
You do?

561
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:34,241
Don't <i>you?</i>

562
01:04:35,576 --> 01:04:36,743
Yeah.

563
01:04:40,415 --> 01:04:42,125
That's me — when I was in the Navy.

564
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,628
You were a general?

565
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:50,215
No! That's was when I was in the band —
the high school band.


567
01:04:52,468 --> 01:04:56,013
Here's <i>you.</i> I like this picture.
Look at that.

568
01:04:57,014 --> 01:04:58,015
That is <i>really</i> wild.

569
01:04:58,348 --> 01:05:04,227
That's weird when it —
when there's water in between — and then it turns into nothing —

569
01:05:04,627 --> 01:05:05,627
and it goes <i>psshhhh.</i>

571
01:05:05,854 --> 01:05:07,063
That's a great picture.

572
01:05:08,273 --> 01:05:09,732
And this is my mom —

573
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:14,692
your grandmother.

574
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:19,450
I didn't know.

575
01:05:23,496 --> 01:05:24,663
It just seems that —

576
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:28,041
everything has changed
between us so fast —

577
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,250
ever since Travis came.

578
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:31,752
What's changed?

579
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:35,130
I'm just afraid.

580
01:05:36,924 --> 01:05:38,298
Afraid of Travis?

581
01:05:39,132 --> 01:05:40,092
No.

582
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:42,469
Then <i>what?</i>

583
01:05:45,055 --> 01:05:47,765
Of what will happen to us if we lose Hunter.

584
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,020
We're not gonna lose Hunter.

585
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:56,065
Then why do you keep pushing them together?

586
01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:59,401
It's almost as if you wanted him to leave.

587
01:05:59,985 --> 01:06:01,363
Who?

587
01:06:01,363 --> 01:06:02,363
<i>Hunter.</i>

588
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:05,782
You know what I'm talking about.

589
01:06:06,157 --> 01:06:09,367
You keep promoting this
father-son business between —

590
01:06:09,826 --> 01:06:11,327
It's not <i>"business."</i>

591
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:15,540
Travis <i>is</i> his father,
and Hunter is his <i>son.</i>

592
01:06:16,497 --> 01:06:17,748
That's a <i>fact.</i>

593
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,834
You've known that all along.

594
01:06:21,502 --> 01:06:23,338
Travis happens to be my brother.

595
01:06:23,672 --> 01:06:24,756
I <i>know</i> he is.

596
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,174
Well — what's this <i>"promotion"</i> bullshit?

597
01:06:27,508 --> 01:06:29,008
You want us to go on pretending —

598
01:06:29,342 --> 01:06:31,803
that we're the parents
of my brother's son?

599
01:06:32,512 --> 01:06:34,264
Well, how long do you expect Hunter
to buy <i>that?</i>

600
01:06:34,597 --> 01:06:36,850
I was never pretending.

601
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:40,979
I love him — just like
he was my own flesh and blood.

602
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:43,772
So do I.

603
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,615
Hi, Ann.

604
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:57,200
Hi, Travis.

605
01:06:57,909 --> 01:06:59,870
You don't sleep much, do you?

606
01:07:09,878 --> 01:07:11,171
Travis.

607
01:07:12,422 --> 01:07:14,466
There is something I have to tell you.

608
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,468
I was not going to —

609
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:20,304
because somehow it makes things easier
that nobody knows.

610
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:24,265
I never even told Walt or Hunter.

611
01:07:26,017 --> 01:07:27,185
What is it?

612
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:32,773
After Hunter came to live with us —

613
01:07:33,523 --> 01:07:34,941
Jane used to call —

614
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,487
asking about him.

615
01:07:38,987 --> 01:07:43,114
She made me promise not to tell anyone
that she was calling.

616
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:45,074
Did she ask about me?

617
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,496
Yes — in the beginning.

618
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:56,126
Where did she call from?

619
01:07:57,502 --> 01:07:59,170
Places in Texas.

620
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:00,922
What places?

621
01:08:04,843 --> 01:08:06,345
Let me finish, Travis.

622
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:12,474
After what happened
between you and Jane —

623
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:16,603
she decided Hunter should be with us.

624
01:08:18,188 --> 01:08:20,981
She said she couldn't be a mother to him any more.

625
01:08:29,155 --> 01:08:32,158
She stopped being a mother to him
a long time before that.

626
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:50,377
Travis. I don't want to feel I'm 
hiding something from you anymore.

628
01:08:56,217 --> 01:08:57,468
She was young —

629
01:09:03,475 --> 01:09:04,685
she wanted something —

630
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,063
but I just couldn't figure out what it was.

631
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:16,825
I just didn't realize how much rage I had.

632
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,504
A little more than a year ago,
she stopped calling.

633
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:31,175
I haven't heard from her since then.

634
01:09:32,843 --> 01:09:33,844
Nothing?

635
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:36,514
Not a word.

636
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:39,560
But on the last call —

637
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:44,191
she asked for me
to open a bank account for Hunter.

638
01:09:45,984 --> 01:09:47,402
A bank account?

639
01:09:47,527 --> 01:09:50,073
All I know about Jane now, is —

640
01:09:51,074 --> 01:09:52,784
she goes to this bank —

641
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:55,620
on the fifth of each month —

642
01:09:56,288 --> 01:09:58,290
and wires money for Hunter.

643
01:10:03,004 --> 01:10:05,090
Jane still sends him money.

644
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:10,971
Sometimes, a hundred dollars —
sometimes, fifty — or five —

645
01:10:11,973 --> 01:10:13,642
for Hunter's future.

646
01:10:14,559 --> 01:10:16,813
I had the bank trace the wire.

647
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,857
It comes from a bank in Houston.

648
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:21,859
What bank?

649
01:10:23,278 --> 01:10:26,073
I wrote it down — if you want it.

650
01:10:29,411 --> 01:10:30,745
What's the date today?

651
01:10:31,287 --> 01:10:32,914
The first of November.

654
01:11:06,454 --> 01:11:10,667
<i>You will all be caught with your diapers down — </i>

655
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:12,669
<i>that is a promise!</i>

656
01:11:13,211 --> 01:11:17,176
<i>I make you this promise on my mother's head.</i>

657
01:11:17,718 --> 01:11:23,433
<i>For right here — today —
standing on the very head of my mother —</i>

658
01:11:23,725 --> 01:11:26,394
<i>which is on God's green earth —</i>

659
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:30,442
<i>which everybody who wasn't born in a fuckin' sewer —</i>

660
01:11:30,776 --> 01:11:35,197
<i>oughta know and understand to the very marrow of their bones.</i>

661
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:39,660
<i>They will invade you in your beds.</i>

662
01:11:40,536 --> 01:11:43,332
<i>They will snatch you from your hot tubs.</i>

663
01:11:44,374 --> 01:11:48,420
<i>They will pluck you right outta your fancy sports cars.</i>

664
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:51,425
<i>There is nowhere —</i>

665
01:11:53,427 --> 01:11:55,096
<i>absolutely nowhere —</i>

666
01:11:55,596 --> 01:11:58,141
<i>in this godforsaken valley.</i>

667
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:03,731
<i>I'm talking about — from the range of my voice, right here —</i>

668
01:12:04,065 --> 01:12:07,235
<i>Clear out to the goddamn Mojave Desert —</i>

669
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:11,490
<i>and beyond that — clear out past Barstow —</i>

670
01:12:13,242 --> 01:12:16,453
<i>and everywhere else in the Valley — 
all the way out to Arizona —</i>

671
01:12:17,664 --> 01:12:20,750
<i>None of that area will be called the Safety Zone.</i>

672
01:12:21,418 --> 01:12:23,505
<i>There will be NO Safety Zone.</i>

673
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,757
<i>I can guarantee you the Safety Zone
will be eliminated —</i>

675
01:12:27,759 --> 01:12:29,302
<i>eradicated!</i>

676
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:34,725
<i>You will all be extradited to the Land of No Return.</i>

677
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,105
<i>It's a navigation to nowhere!</i>

678
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:41,358
<i>And if you think that's going to be fun —</i>

679
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,028
<i>you've got another thing coming.</i>

680
01:12:46,197 --> 01:12:48,366
<i>I may be a slimebucket —</i>

681
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:52,913
<i>But believe me — I know what the hell I'm talking about.</i>

682
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:55,125
<i>I'm NOT crazy!</i>

683
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:59,839
<i>And don't say I didn't warn you! I WARNED you!</i>

684
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:01,841
<i>I warned ALL of you!</i>

685
01:13:13,313 --> 01:13:15,064
Thought you were afraid of heights!

686
01:13:15,732 --> 01:13:18,360
No — I'm not afraid of heights —
I'm afraid of <i>falling.</i>

687
01:13:19,153 --> 01:13:20,905
Oh yeah? 
Well — just don't look down.

688
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:27,287
Too bad things don't look
the same on the ground.

689
01:13:28,164 --> 01:13:29,207
What do you mean?

690
01:13:31,502 --> 01:13:32,920
Things are clearer, up here.

691
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,964
Might clear things up.

692
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:38,635
Yeah — I had a talk with Ann last night —

693
01:13:39,427 --> 01:13:40,929
yeah — she's pretty upset.

694
01:13:42,096 --> 01:13:43,306
Yeah — I know.

695
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:46,352
I'm gonna leave.

696
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:48,063
What?

696
01:13:48,064 --> 01:13:49,063
I'm leaving.

697
01:13:49,939 --> 01:13:53,401
I didn't tell you this in order to make you leave —
I'm not trying to get <i>rid</i> of you, Travis —

698
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:54,821
I know that.

698
01:13:54,527 --> 01:13:55,821
Well — what good is <i>that</i> gonna do?

699
01:13:55,821 --> 01:13:57,573
That's not gonna solve anything.

700
01:13:58,491 --> 01:14:00,409
I'm gonna find Jane.

701
01:14:01,954 --> 01:14:03,247
How're you gonna do that?

702
01:14:03,832 --> 01:14:06,000
It's been four years.
She's completely disappeared —

703
01:14:06,376 --> 01:14:08,253
I tried to find her — I tried <i>everything</i> —
I couldn't find her.

704
01:14:08,586 --> 01:14:11,132
Well, <i>I</i> haven't tried yet.
I can find her.

705
01:14:11,298 --> 01:14:12,258
What makes you so sure?

706
01:14:12,591 --> 01:14:14,009
I just <i>know.</i>

707
01:14:14,677 --> 01:14:15,886
Can we go down now?

708
01:14:16,011 --> 01:14:17,516
<i>No.</i>

708
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:19,516
<i>Goddammit —</i>

709
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:22,185
You <i>tell</i> me what happened,
Travis!

710
01:14:22,602 --> 01:14:24,063
I'm <i>sick</i> of this fuckin' mystery!

711
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:27,733
I've been treating you like a spoiled kid
ever since I picked you up in the desert!

713
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:30,904
Now, you <i>tell</i> me what happened
with you and Jane!

714
01:14:31,947 --> 01:14:32,781
<i>Shit.</i>

715
01:14:34,409 --> 01:14:36,494
I know —
it's none of my business.

716
01:14:37,955 --> 01:14:40,791
Uh —
well, I need to take —

717
01:14:42,001 --> 01:14:44,129
money — credit cards —

718
01:14:44,629 --> 01:14:46,214
Alright — sure — you can have 'em.

719
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:47,507
You know you'll get it back —

720
01:14:47,799 --> 01:14:49,342
Oh — forget that. You can have 'em.

721
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,179
I wanna find her, Walt.

722
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:18,545
Hunter.

723
01:15:28,556 --> 01:15:29,849
That your car?

724
01:15:33,813 --> 01:15:36,315
Yup! <i>C'mon!</i>

725
01:15:38,068 --> 01:15:39,278
<i>Radical.</i>

726
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:54,879
This is not bad stuff.

727
01:15:56,881 --> 01:15:58,884
Ann puts it in lunch, every day.

728
01:15:59,218 --> 01:16:02,179
La Vache Qui Rit. <i>Sticky.</i>

729
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:03,848
La Vache <i>what?</i>

730
01:16:06,017 --> 01:16:07,602
<i>Rit.</i> <i>Rrrr-rrrit.</i>

731
01:16:08,186 --> 01:16:09,604
<i>Rit.</i> <i>Rrrr-rrrit.</i>

732
01:16:11,064 --> 01:16:12,442
I like it.

733
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:15,321
Dad —

733
01:16:15,653 --> 01:16:16,321
Yeah?

734
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,575
Where'd you go,
all that time?

735
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,288
Mexico.

736
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,332
How come?

737
01:16:27,168 --> 01:16:28,878
I didn't know where else to go.

738
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:32,507
Where'd Mom go?

739
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:35,469
I don't know.

740
01:16:36,428 --> 01:16:38,554
But right now, 
she's somewhere in Houston.

741
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:40,433
That's where the Space Center is!

742
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:46,483
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

743
01:16:47,484 --> 01:16:48,776
I gotta go away now.

744
01:16:49,486 --> 01:16:50,445
Why?

745
01:16:51,572 --> 01:16:52,823
Because I'm gonna find her.

746
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:56,202
What about <i>me?</i> You just found <i>me.</i>
Can I come with?

747
01:17:01,374 --> 01:17:02,417
What about Walt and Ann?

748
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,338
You mean, we'd never come back here?

749
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:06,964
Wel, sure, but —

750
01:17:08,132 --> 01:17:10,133
I dunno when.

751
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:20,523
I want to come with.

752
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:25,487
I wanna find her, too.

753
01:17:26,112 --> 01:17:27,364
When do we go?

754
01:17:32,787 --> 01:17:33,788
Right now.

755
01:17:34,205 --> 01:17:35,748
Then c'mon —  let's go.

756
01:17:36,415 --> 01:17:39,002
First, we gotta stop
and get supplies for the trip.

757
01:17:39,086 --> 01:17:39,920
Okay.

758
01:17:55,564 --> 01:17:59,360
We gotta buy jackets — T-shirts —
toothbrushes — stuff like that —

760
01:17:59,485 --> 01:18:01,362
maybe even walkie-talkies!

761
01:18:01,863 --> 01:18:03,322
Talkies — of course!

762
01:18:03,948 --> 01:18:05,032
Just in case!

763
01:18:14,836 --> 01:18:16,171
Do you know what?

764
01:18:16,629 --> 01:18:17,672
What?

765
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:22,722
This whole galaxy —
the whole universe —

766
01:18:23,055 --> 01:18:26,852
used to be compressed
into a tiny spot — <i>this</i> big.

767
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:29,572
And — and —
you know what happened?

767
01:18:29,769 --> 01:18:30,572
What?

768
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,651
It went <i>pshhhhh</i> and blew up.

769
01:18:34,027 --> 01:18:37,322
All the spark —
everything went flying all over the place —

770
01:18:37,614 --> 01:18:39,450
and formed space —

771
01:18:39,626 --> 01:18:42,244
it was just <i>gas.</i> It was floating around —

772
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:43,621
The Earth was?

773
01:18:43,954 --> 01:18:45,957
Yeah — the Earth was really <i>gas.</i>

774
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:49,711
And — and the Sun formed —
and it was so hot —

775
01:18:50,003 --> 01:18:54,509
that the Earth just formed
into one hard, big ball —

776
01:18:54,967 --> 01:18:57,638
of ocean —
nothing but ocean.

777
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:01,391
So there was sea animals,
and under the water —

778
01:19:01,433 --> 01:19:04,145
a volcano went <i>pshhhhh</i> —

779
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:07,316
And — 
the hot lava hit the water —

780
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:10,402
and formed rock — to make land.

781
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,710
You know how to make a collect call?

782
01:19:25,002 --> 01:19:26,839
You dial the operator, and tell her that —

783
01:19:26,964 --> 01:19:28,049
I <i>know.</i>

784
01:19:28,424 --> 01:19:30,802
Good —
then call Walt and Ann.

785
01:19:31,177 --> 01:19:32,136
Why?

786
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:34,557
Because —
so they don't worry about you —

787
01:19:34,598 --> 01:19:35,683
so they know where you are.

788
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:37,643
But what am I gonna <i>say?</i>

789
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:39,019
Just tell 'em the truth.

790
01:19:39,396 --> 01:19:42,774
Tell them that you're with me,
and that we're going to Texas.

791
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:45,110
They're gonna flip out.

792
01:19:45,443 --> 01:19:48,114
<i>No</i> — 
but you can handle it.

793
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,323
Okay?

794
01:19:49,574 --> 01:19:51,033
Why can't <i>you</i> do it?

795
01:19:51,409 --> 01:19:52,953
<i>I</i> can't do it.

796
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:55,455
<i>Why?</i>

797
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:57,833
Because it has to be <i>you.</i>

798
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,299
Oh, <i>geez.</i>

799
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,676
Why can't <i>he</i> do anything —

800
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:13,477
Hello —

801
01:20:13,686 --> 01:20:15,229
Hunter. Where are you?

802
01:20:15,563 --> 01:20:18,065
You know what time it is?
I've been calling <i>everywhere</i> looking for you.

803
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,281
Yeah, yeah — 
Hunter — just listen to me, now.

804
01:20:24,615 --> 01:20:26,784
Where <i>are</i> you, exactly?

805
01:20:29,412 --> 01:20:30,997
San Bernadino?

806
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:34,419
Hunter — what do you <i>mean</i>
you're in San Bernadino?

807
01:20:34,961 --> 01:20:35,837
Wait, honey.

808
01:20:36,004 --> 01:20:36,672
How did —

808
01:20:36,504 --> 01:20:37,672
Let me talk to him.

809
01:20:38,882 --> 01:20:40,009
<i>Hunter.</i>

810
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,220
Are you alright?

812
01:20:44,055 --> 01:20:45,556
What are you <i>doing?</i>

813
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:49,728
With Travis?

814
01:20:52,356 --> 01:20:53,942
Where are you <i>going?</i>

815
01:20:56,694 --> 01:21:00,491
<i>Tell</i> me where you are Hunter —
just <i>tell</i> me where you are.

816
01:21:02,493 --> 01:21:04,203
What's the name of it?

817
01:21:05,663 --> 01:21:06,749
Oh my <i>god.</i>

818
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,043
<i>Hunter.</i>

819
01:21:09,919 --> 01:21:12,505
You tell Travis to turn around —

820
01:21:12,838 --> 01:21:15,425
And come back here,
<i>right</i> now.

821
01:21:15,842 --> 01:21:17,302
Do you understand me?

822
01:21:18,262 --> 01:21:19,429
Let me talk to him.

823
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,267
What should I do?

824
01:21:23,226 --> 01:21:25,019
Just hang up.

825
01:21:27,773 --> 01:21:29,692
Bye, Mom. Gotta go now!

826
01:21:32,111 --> 01:21:33,112
Hunter —

827
01:21:34,781 --> 01:21:36,032
<i>Hunter!</i>

828
01:21:53,471 --> 01:21:54,472
Did they flip out?

829
01:21:54,848 --> 01:21:56,099
Yeah — she did.

830
01:21:56,725 --> 01:21:58,560
You're not sorry you came,
are you?

831
01:21:58,643 --> 01:21:59,519
No.

832
01:21:59,895 --> 01:22:02,648
Well — you can go back to them
any time you want.

833
01:22:03,024 --> 01:22:04,066
You just tell me, okay?

834
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,902
I don't wanna go back.

835
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:09,615
Well — I know — but just in case
you change your mind.

836
01:22:56,003 --> 01:22:58,464
I'm so used to calling her <i>"Mom."</i>

837
01:23:00,759 --> 01:23:02,052
Ann?

838
01:23:02,803 --> 01:23:03,679
Yeah.

839
01:23:08,893 --> 01:23:11,187
She sounded so sad.

840
01:23:14,316 --> 01:23:15,442
I know.

841
01:23:19,573 --> 01:23:22,034
What do you think Mom 
will look like, now?

842
01:23:26,873 --> 01:23:28,125
I dunno.

843
01:23:31,461 --> 01:23:32,921
Do you remember her?

844
01:23:34,007 --> 01:23:37,760
Not really —
only from that little movie we saw.

845
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,773
You looked happy, then.

846
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:51,235
Yeah.

847
01:23:58,076 --> 01:23:59,536
You keep that.

848
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:18,683
<i>Night.</i>

849
01:25:00,567 --> 01:25:05,489
Dad — 
if a guy put a baby down —

850
01:25:05,489 --> 01:25:08,703
travelled at the speed of light
for —

851
01:25:09,287 --> 01:25:11,455
If he travelled at the speed of light —

852
01:25:11,789 --> 01:25:16,211
He would come back in an hour —
he would be an hour <i>older</i> —

854
01:25:16,295 --> 01:25:19,464
but the little baby 
would be a very old man.

855
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:22,510
Oh yeah?

856
01:25:22,635 --> 01:25:25,054
Well, how long would it take him
to get to Houston?

857
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:33,440
Uh — if they were to travel —
I'd say about three seconds.

859
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:37,987
Uh — over —
I didn't get that last part.

860
01:25:39,739 --> 01:25:43,491
It would take them three seconds
to get from California to Houston —

862
01:25:44,786 --> 01:25:46,496
on light-speed.

863
01:25:55,132 --> 01:25:56,426
This is Houston?

863
01:25:56,532 --> 01:25:57,426
Yup.

864
01:25:57,968 --> 01:26:00,930
How are we gonna find her
in a big city like this?

865
01:26:01,306 --> 01:26:02,601
I know where she'll be.

865
01:26:02,306 --> 01:26:03,601
Where?

866
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,605
A bank. She's gonna deposit
some money at a certain bank today.

867
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:12,653
This is a <i>bank?</i>

868
01:26:13,403 --> 01:26:15,323
What kind of bank <i>is</i> this?

869
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,450
Looks like a drive-in.

870
01:26:17,784 --> 01:26:20,036
I've never seen a bank like <i>that.</i>

871
01:26:21,037 --> 01:26:22,373
Me neither.

872
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:26,377
There are so many cars —
we'll <i>never</i> find her.

873
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:28,797
Oh — yeah, we will.
<i>C'mon.</i>

874
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:32,008
We will split up — and then
we'll cover more ground — okay?

875
01:26:32,884 --> 01:26:35,055
Yeah — we could use the walkie-talkies.

876
01:26:35,389 --> 01:26:37,266
Hey — <i>now</i> you're going.

877
01:26:37,599 --> 01:26:38,810
I'll let you out here.

877
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:39,810
Okay.

878
01:26:46,985 --> 01:26:48,821
Can you hear me, Dad?
Over.

879
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,031
Loud and clear.

880
01:26:52,825 --> 01:26:53,659
<i>Good.</i>

881
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:20,733
Hunter in Position 1. 
Over.

882
01:27:21,817 --> 01:27:24,571
Travis in Position 2 —
we got it covered.

883
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,866
I <i>told</i> you it'd be
more than toys. Over.

884
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:30,077
10-4 — over and out.

885
01:29:10,447 --> 01:29:12,866
Dad —
she's just leaving the bank.

886
01:29:13,241 --> 01:29:14,409
Get <i>over</i> here.

887
01:29:14,743 --> 01:29:17,581
Dad — can you hear me?
Can you <i>hear me?</i>

888
01:29:22,377 --> 01:29:25,923
She's leaving the <i>bank!</i>
Get <i>over</i> here!

889
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:28,301
<i>Dad!</i>

890
01:29:28,718 --> 01:29:30,095
<i>Come on!</i>

891
01:29:30,596 --> 01:29:33,098
<i>Dad!</i> Wake up!

892
01:29:33,724 --> 01:29:36,645
Wake <i>up!</i> She's <i>leaving!</i>
She's leaving the bank!

893
01:29:37,604 --> 01:29:39,189
<i>Dad!</i> Wake up!

894
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:43,319
Is she — where —

895
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,696

898

C'mon — c'mon — <i>c'mon!</i> Let's go!

900
01:30:32,377 --> 01:30:35,547
Hunter — did you really
get a good look at her, or what?

901
01:30:35,922 --> 01:30:38,426
It was the right one —
I <i>know</i> it was her!

902
01:30:38,551 --> 01:30:40,594
Oh, god — I hope we haven't lost her.

904
01:30:45,225 --> 01:30:47,602
There's ten thousand cars here, Hunter —
how're we gonna find her?

905
01:30:47,728 --> 01:30:48,687
I dunno — which one is it?

906
01:30:49,062 --> 01:30:50,606
Go faster, Dad! Go faster!

907
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:53,318
Wh — what colour —
the car was red, right?

908
01:30:53,651 --> 01:30:56,238
Yeah — a little red <i>Chevy.</i>

909
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:03,497
Do you see anything?
Yeah — I don't which one it looks like, Hunter —

910
01:31:03,789 --> 01:31:05,916
you'll have to help me look —
can you see it?

911
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:07,793
No — not yet.

912
01:31:10,213 --> 01:31:11,799

915
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:20,558
Alright, alright —
settle down — I see it.

916
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:27,816
Is that her — look —
see if it's her. Can you tell?

917
01:31:29,569 --> 01:31:31,405
I can't tell.

921
01:31:40,289 --> 01:31:41,458
Yeah, the left one!

922
01:31:41,532 --> 01:31:42,469
Okay.

922
01:31:48,132 --> 01:31:49,469
You're <i>sure</i> this is the one, though —

922
01:31:49,532 --> 01:31:50,469
Yeah!

922
01:31:49,532 --> 01:31:42,469
Okay.

923
01:31:55,641 --> 01:31:57,648
I hope you're right, Hunter.

923
01:31:57,641 --> 01:32:00,648
If we're following the wrong car,
we're gonna have to wait a whole other month.

Let's get closer! We could wave!

928
01:32:13,455 --> 01:32:17,502
No, no, no — we don't wanna get too close —
we might scare her —

929
01:32:17,502 --> 01:32:19,045
she'd have a wreck or something.

931
01:32:34,188 --> 01:32:37,693
Well — I wonder where she's going.

932
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,404
Maybe to work — what do you think?

933
01:32:41,405 --> 01:32:42,906
Yeah — could be.

934
01:33:54,866 --> 01:33:56,618
Looks like a girl's car to me.

935
01:33:57,285 --> 01:33:58,830
Could it be hers?

936
01:34:01,124 --> 01:34:03,710
Could be — get in the truck
and I'll tell you my plan.

No — no — no — <i>no!</i>

1036
01:47:04,302 --> 01:47:05,845
<i>Please.</i>

1036
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47,07,000
Please.

1037
01:47:08,097 --> 01:47:09,641
Please don't go.

1038
01:47:14,688 --> 01:47:17,650
I just don't think
I'm the one you wanna talk to.

1039
01:47:20,029 --> 01:47:21,405
Please.

1040
01:47:22,824 --> 01:47:24,659
Please don't go — I'm sorry.

1041
01:47:34,378 --> 01:47:35,421
Alright.

1042
01:47:42,721 --> 01:47:45,765
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1043
01:47:51,566 --> 01:47:52,651
That's okay. 

1044
01:48:02,832 --> 01:48:08,126
Y'know — I know how hard it is
to talk to strangers, sometimes.

1045
01:48:13,675 --> 01:48:15,218
Just relax.

1046
01:48:17,138 --> 01:48:19,265
Relax, and tell me
what's on your mind.

1047
01:48:21,851 --> 01:48:23,228
I'll listen —

1048
01:48:25,773 --> 01:48:26,732
— to you.

1049
01:48:32,406 --> 01:48:34,449
I don't mind listening.

1050
01:48:42,876 --> 01:48:45,087
I do it all the time.

1051
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:08,282
She was there, wasn't she?

1052
01:49:47,328 --> 01:49:48,704
What's that?

1053
01:49:54,962 --> 01:49:56,129
A vacant lot.

1054
01:49:57,006 --> 01:50:00,716
I bought that land
when we were all together — with your mom.

1056
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:07,185
I thought we might live there, someday.

1057
01:50:09,521 --> 01:50:10,606
Where?

1058
01:50:11,524 --> 01:50:12,733
Paris —

1059
01:50:13,818 --> 01:50:14,819
Texas.

1060
01:50:15,152 --> 01:50:16,237
Where's that?

1061
01:50:17,906 --> 01:50:19,783
Across the Red River.

1062
01:50:24,956 --> 01:50:26,249
You like it?

1063
01:50:28,168 --> 01:50:29,711
You mean, we'd live on dirt?

1064
01:50:45,272 --> 01:50:48,192
Why do you drink that stuff?
It <i>stinks.</i>

1065
01:50:50,194 --> 01:50:51,654
Wait a minute — where are you going?

1066
01:50:52,071 --> 01:50:53,448
To the truck.

1067
01:51:13,764 --> 01:51:15,098
Have another one?

1068
01:52:24,973 --> 01:52:28,019
This is not a place
to bring a fancy woman.

1069
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:35,194
Would you say — if you had a fancy woman —
would you bring her in a place like this?

1070
01:52:35,819 --> 01:52:37,696
What's a fancy woman?

1071
01:52:58,055 --> 01:52:59,014
My mother.

1072
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:03,393
Not <i>your</i> mother —

1073
01:53:04,686 --> 01:53:05,980
but <i>my</i> mother —

1074
01:53:06,648 --> 01:53:08,942
was <i>not</i> a fancy woman.

1075
01:53:09,192 --> 01:53:10,735
She was —

1076
01:53:17,034 --> 01:53:21,290
She never wanted to be a fancy woman —
she never even <i>pretended</i> to be a fancy woman.

1077
01:53:22,291 --> 01:53:23,751
Then what was she?

1078
01:53:24,669 --> 01:53:26,713
She was just — plain.

1079
01:53:29,174 --> 01:53:31,009
Just plain — good.

1080
01:53:32,262 --> 01:53:34,138
She was very good.

1081
01:53:34,764 --> 01:53:35,974
But my daddy —

1082
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:40,980
See — my daddy had, uh —

1083
01:53:41,939 --> 01:53:43,649
He had this idea —

1084
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:47,863
he had this idea in his head
that was kind of —

1085
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,699
kind of a sickness —

1086
01:53:52,286 --> 01:53:53,245
What idea?

1087
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:56,164
He had this idea about <i>her.</i>

1088
01:54:00,044 --> 01:54:01,588
He looked at her —

1089
01:54:03,089 --> 01:54:04,883
but he didn't see her.

1090
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:09,138
He —

1091
01:54:09,763 --> 01:54:11,599
he saw this idea —

1092
01:54:15,228 --> 01:54:19,609
and he told people that she was from Paris —

1093
01:54:21,652 --> 01:54:23,279
it was a big joke.

1094
01:54:23,613 --> 01:54:25,408
He started telling everybody all the time —

1095
01:54:25,783 --> 01:54:27,869
finally it wasn't a joke anymore —

1096
01:54:31,122 --> 01:54:32,750
He started believing it.

1097
01:54:34,793 --> 01:54:35,920
And —

1098
01:54:36,462 --> 01:54:38,130
He actually believed —

1099
01:54:41,051 --> 01:54:42,260
She —

1100
01:54:43,178 --> 01:54:44,471
Oh, god.

1101
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,767
She would get so embarrassed.

1102
01:54:50,269 --> 01:54:51,312
She'd —

1103
01:54:52,481 --> 01:54:53,941
She was so —

1104
01:54:56,778 --> 01:54:58,738
She was so <i>shy.</i>

1105
01:55:47,796 --> 01:55:49,381
<i>Vamonos, muchacho.</i>

1106
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:19,752
Left, Dad.

1107
01:56:35,646 --> 01:56:37,522
Hunter — it's me.

1108
01:56:40,652 --> 01:56:45,782
I was afraid I'd never be able to say
the right words to you — in person.


1110
01:56:46,617 --> 01:56:50,371
So — I'm trying to do it like this.

1111
01:56:53,625 --> 01:56:59,005
When I first saw you — this time
at Walt's —

1113
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:03,886
I was hoping for all kinds of things.

1114
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:09,602
I was hoping to show you
that I was your father.

1115
01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:14,108
You showed me I was.

1116
01:57:17,861 --> 01:57:20,115
But the biggest thing I hoped for —

1117
01:57:23,034 --> 01:57:24,661
can't come true.

1118
01:57:27,331 --> 01:57:28,916
I know that now.

1119
01:57:31,794 --> 01:57:33,630
You belong together, with your mother.

1120
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:38,552
<i>You belong together, with your mother.</i>

1121
01:57:40,764 --> 01:57:43,142
<i>It was me that tore you apart.</i>

1122
01:57:43,809 --> 01:57:46,938
<i>And I owe it to you
to bring you back together.</i>

1123
01:57:49,107 --> 01:57:50,984
<i>But I can't stay with you.</i>

1124
01:57:51,443 --> 01:57:53,613
<i>I could never heal up what happened.</i>

1125
01:57:54,822 --> 01:57:57,241
<i>That's just the way it is.</i>

1126
01:57:58,826 --> 01:58:01,622
<i>I can't even hardly remember what happened —</i>

1127
01:58:02,331 --> 01:58:03,749
<i>it's like a gap.</i>

1128
01:58:04,666 --> 01:58:09,339
<i>It left me alone in a way that
I haven't gotten over.</i>

1130
01:58:10,173 --> 01:58:13,133
<i>And right now —
I'm afraid.</i>

1132
01:58:15,305 --> 01:58:18,099
<i>I'm afraid of walking away again.</i>

1133
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:20,770
<i>I'm afraid of what I might find.</i>

1134
01:58:22,563 --> 01:58:27,607
<i>But I'm even more afraid of
not facing this fear.</i>

1136
01:58:28,570 --> 01:58:30,280
<i>I love you, Hunter.</i>

1137
01:58:32,282 --> 01:58:34,619
<i>I love you more than my life.</i>

1138
01:58:46,091 --> 01:58:47,678
Hey!

1138
01:58:47,091 --> 01:58:48,678
Hey.

1139
01:58:54,601 --> 01:58:56,228
Can I tell you something?

1140
01:58:58,981 --> 01:59:01,359
Sure — anything you like.

1141
01:59:03,152 --> 01:59:04,529
It's kinda long.

1142
01:59:06,281 --> 01:59:07,908
I have plenty of time.

1143
01:59:31,854 --> 01:59:33,480
I knew these people —

1144
01:59:34,274 --> 01:59:35,358
What people?

1145
01:59:37,402 --> 01:59:38,862
These two people —

1146
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:46,370
they were in love with each other —

1147
01:59:49,708 --> 01:59:51,126
The girl was —

1148
01:59:51,711 --> 01:59:56,050
very young — about 17 or 18 —
I guess.

1149
01:59:57,468 --> 02:00:00,969
And the guy was quite a bit older —

1151
02:00:02,557 --> 02:00:05,352
and he was kinda raggedy and wild —

1152
02:00:06,895 --> 02:00:08,773
and she was very beautiful, y'know?

1153
02:00:11,567 --> 02:00:12,401
Yeah.

1154
02:00:13,194 --> 02:00:17,157
And together, they turned everything
into a kind of an adventure —

1155
02:00:18,617 --> 02:00:20,077
and she liked that.

1156
02:00:21,621 --> 02:00:24,959
Just an ordinary trip
down to the grocery store was —

1157
02:00:25,542 --> 02:00:27,127
full of adventure.

1158
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:32,008
And they were always laughing
at stupid things.

1159
02:00:32,384 --> 02:00:34,220
He liked to make her laugh.

1160
02:00:35,805 --> 02:00:36,847
And —

1161
02:00:39,058 --> 02:00:41,436
they didn't much care for anything else.

1162
02:00:42,229 --> 02:00:45,649
'Cause all they wanted to do
was be with each other.

1163
02:00:47,568 --> 02:00:49,404
They were always together.

1164
02:00:50,196 --> 02:00:52,407
Sounds like they were very happy.

1165
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:57,289
Yes. They were — they were real happy.

1166
02:00:58,873 --> 02:00:59,916
And he —

1167
02:01:00,458 --> 02:01:02,169
Hey loved her more than —

1168
02:01:04,588 --> 02:01:06,465
he ever felt possible.

1169
02:01:09,803 --> 02:01:12,180
He couldn't stand being away from her —

1170
02:01:12,264 --> 02:01:14,517
during the day — when he went to work.

1171
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:21,233
So he quit —

1172
02:01:22,901 --> 02:01:24,653
just to be home with her.

1173
02:01:25,529 --> 02:01:28,074
And then he'd get another job
when the money ran out —

1174
02:01:29,827 --> 02:01:31,662
and then he'd quit again.

1175
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:35,292
But —
pretty soon, she started to worry.

1176
02:01:39,713 --> 02:01:41,799
'Bout what?

1176
02:01:40,500 --> 2:01:41,799
Money, I guess —

1177
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:43,926
not having enough —

1178
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:46,554
not knowing when the next check
was coming in.

1179
02:01:49,016 --> 02:01:51,310
<i>Yep.</i> I know that feeling.

1180
02:01:51,935 --> 02:01:56,438
So — he started to get kinda
torn inside.

1182
02:02:00,278 --> 02:02:01,489
How do you mean?

1183
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:05,118
Well, he knew he had to work
to support her —

1184
02:02:06,119 --> 02:02:08,539
but he couldn't stand
being away from her, either.

1185
02:02:10,875 --> 02:02:12,168
I see.

1186
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:15,839
And the more he was away from her,
the crazier he got.

1187
02:02:17,299 --> 02:02:20,052
Except now, he got <i>really</i> crazy.

1188
02:02:23,807 --> 02:02:25,934
He started imagining all kinds of things.

1189
02:02:28,187 --> 02:02:29,146
Like what?

1190
02:02:31,691 --> 02:02:35,195
He started thinking
she was seeing other men on the sly.

1191
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:42,576
He'd come home from work
and accuse her of spending the day with somebody else.

1193
02:02:42,747 --> 02:02:45,250
He'd yell at her
and break things in the trailer.

1194
02:02:48,379 --> 02:02:49,422
The trailer —

1195
02:02:54,969 --> 02:02:56,054
Yes.

1196
02:02:57,556 --> 02:02:59,391
They lived in a trailer home.

1197
02:03:14,909 --> 02:03:17,747
'Scuse me, sir —
but were you into this with me, the other day?

1198
02:03:19,248 --> 02:03:20,624
I don't mean to pry.

1199
02:03:23,045 --> 02:03:23,920
No.

1200
02:03:25,714 --> 02:03:26,632
Oh.

1201
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:33,014
I thought I recognized
your voice for a minute.

1202
02:03:34,432 --> 02:03:37,851
No —
wasn't me.

1204
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:40,563
Mmm-<i>hmm.</i>

1205
02:03:42,777 --> 02:03:43,903
Please go on.

1206
02:03:47,156 --> 02:03:50,452
Anyway — he started to drink real bad —

1207
02:03:51,536 --> 02:03:54,164
and he'd stay out late to test her.

1208
02:03:56,542 --> 02:03:58,378
What do you mean — test her?

1209
02:03:59,462 --> 02:04:01,297
To see if she'd get jealous.

1210
02:04:03,175 --> 02:04:05,260
Heh — mmm-hmm.

1211
02:04:07,721 --> 02:04:11,142
He wanted her to get jealous —
but she didn't.

1212
02:04:11,559 --> 02:04:16,061
She just worried about him —
but that got him even madder.

1214
02:04:17,693 --> 02:04:18,860
<i>Why?</i>

1215
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,863
Because —

1216
02:04:23,116 --> 02:04:25,952
He thought that if she never got jealous of him,
that she didn't really <i>care</i> about him.

1217
02:04:27,787 --> 02:04:31,250
Jealousy was a sign of her love for him.

1218
02:04:32,209 --> 02:04:33,877
And then one night —

1219
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:38,091
One night, she told him that she was pregnant.

1220
02:04:39,009 --> 02:04:41,594
She was about three or four months pregnant —

1221
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:43,681
and he didn't even know.

1222
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:46,601
And then, suddenly, everything changed.

1223
02:04:47,686 --> 02:04:50,773
He stopped drinking
and got a steady job.

1224
02:04:51,649 --> 02:04:53,609
He was <i>convinced</i>
that she loved him now —

1225
02:04:53,693 --> 02:04:55,863
because she was carrying his child.

1226
02:04:56,822 --> 02:05:00,576
And he was going to dedicate himself
to making a home for her.

1227
02:05:01,827 --> 02:05:03,913
But a funny thing started to happen.

1228
02:05:04,456 --> 02:05:05,665
<i>What?</i>

1229
02:05:06,249 --> 02:05:08,543
He didn't even notice it, at first.

1230
02:05:08,918 --> 02:05:10,880
<i>She</i> started to change.

1231
02:05:11,672 --> 02:05:16,215
From the day the baby was born,
she began to get irritated with everything around her.

1233
02:05:16,511 --> 02:05:18,221
She got <i>mad</i> at everything.

1234
02:05:19,474 --> 02:05:22,477
Even the baby seemed
to be an injustice to her.

1235
02:05:23,062 --> 02:05:25,689
He kept trying to make everything
alright for her —

1236
02:05:25,981 --> 02:05:27,441
buy her things —

1237
02:05:27,441 --> 02:05:29,778
take her out to dinner once a week —

1238
02:05:30,487 --> 02:05:32,530
But nothing seemed to satisfy her.

1239
02:05:33,323 --> 02:05:36,786
For two years, he struggled
to pull them back together —

1240
02:05:36,869 --> 02:05:39,246
like the were when they first met.

1241
02:05:40,498 --> 02:05:44,336
But finally, he knew
that it was never gonna work out.

1242
02:05:46,463 --> 02:05:48,256
So he hit the bottle again —

1243
02:05:48,632 --> 02:05:50,843
but this time it got <i>mean.</i>

1244
02:05:51,929 --> 02:05:54,098
This time, when he came home
late at night,

1245
02:05:54,431 --> 02:05:57,143
she wasn't worried about him —
or jealous.

1246
02:05:57,894 --> 02:06:00,063
She was just enraged.

1247
02:06:01,606 --> 02:06:05,943
She accused him of holding her captive
by making her have a baby.

1249
02:06:08,156 --> 02:06:10,451
She told him
that she dreamed about escaping.

1250
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,913
That was all she dreamed about — escape.

1251
02:06:15,123 --> 02:06:18,377
She saw herself at night —
running naked down a highway —

1252
02:06:19,044 --> 02:06:20,921
running across fields —

1253
02:06:21,296 --> 02:06:22,966
running down river beds —

1254
02:06:23,383 --> 02:06:24,635
always running.

1255
02:06:25,094 --> 02:06:29,555
And always, when she was
just about to get away, he would be there —

1257
02:06:29,808 --> 02:06:31,476
he would stop her somehow —

1258
02:06:33,228 --> 02:06:35,147
he would just appear and stop her.

1259
02:06:38,609 --> 02:06:42,238
And when she told him these dreams,
he believed them.

1260
02:06:43,198 --> 02:06:46,616
He knew she had to be stopped,
or she would leave him forever.

1262
02:06:47,327 --> 02:06:52,921
So he tied a cowbell to her ankle,
so he could hear at night if she tried to get out of bed.

1264
02:06:54,044 --> 02:06:57,758
But she learned how to muffle the bell
by stuffing a sock into it.

1265
02:06:58,091 --> 02:07:02,552
And inching her way out of the bed —
and into the night.

1267
02:07:04,223 --> 02:07:06,100
He caught her one night,
when the sock fell out — 

1268
02:07:06,267 --> 02:07:08,603
and he heard her
trying to run to the highway.

1269
02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:14,983
He caught her, dragged her back to the trailer,
and tied her to the stove with his belt.

1271
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:17,906
He just left her there —

1272
02:07:18,490 --> 02:07:19,949
went back to bed —

1273
02:07:21,409 --> 02:07:23,454
— and laid there, listening to her scream.

1274
02:07:25,164 --> 02:07:27,375
Then he'd listen to his <i>son</i> scream.

1275
02:07:29,585 --> 02:07:34,092
He was surprised at himself,
because he didn't feel anything anymore.

1276
02:07:36,552 --> 02:07:39,264
All he wanted to do was sleep.

1277
02:07:41,558 --> 02:07:45,563
And for the first time, he wished he were far away —

1278
02:07:49,526 --> 02:07:53,197
lost in a deep, vast, country where nobody knew him —

1279
02:07:54,448 --> 02:07:56,158
somewhere without language —

1280
02:07:57,285 --> 02:07:58,620
or streets.

1281
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:02,875
And he dreamed about this place
without knowing its name.

1282
02:08:04,169 --> 02:08:07,546
And when he woke up,
he was on fire.

1284
02:08:10,427 --> 02:08:13,430
There were blue flames
burning the sheets of his bed.

1285
02:08:14,514 --> 02:08:19,349
He ran through the flames,
toward the only two people he loved —

1287
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,356
but they were gone.

1288
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:26,945
His arms were burning —

1289
02:08:27,237 --> 02:08:33,156
and he threw himself outside
and rolled on the wet ground —

1291
02:08:36,081 --> 02:08:37,417
Then he ran.

1292
02:08:39,335 --> 02:08:41,421
He never looked back at the fire.

1293
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:45,718
He just ran.

1294
02:08:52,476 --> 02:08:54,519
He ran until the sun came up —

1295
02:08:56,396 --> 02:08:58,316
and he couldn't run any further.

1296
02:09:00,651 --> 02:09:05,403
And when the sun went down,
he ran again.

1298
02:09:11,123 --> 02:09:13,459
For five days, he ran like this —

1299
02:09:15,628 --> 02:09:17,672
until every sign of man —

1300
02:09:20,717 --> 02:09:22,219
had disappeared.

1301
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:34,984
<i>Travis.</i>

1302
02:10:18,203 --> 02:10:21,872
If you turn the light off in there,
will you be able to see me?

1304
02:10:29,841 --> 02:10:30,925
I don't know.

1305
02:10:36,307 --> 02:10:37,725
I've never tried.

1306
02:10:56,956 --> 02:10:58,167
Can you see me?

1307
02:11:00,836 --> 02:11:02,129
<i>Yeah.</i>

1308
02:11:03,589 --> 02:11:05,008
Do you recognize me?

1309
02:11:07,969 --> 02:11:09,513
Oh, <i>Travis.</i>

1310
02:11:17,105 --> 02:11:19,149
I brought Hunter with me.

1311
02:11:31,748 --> 02:11:33,083
Don't you want to see him?

1312
02:11:36,253 --> 02:11:37,295
Yeah.

1313
02:11:46,765 --> 02:11:51,061
I wanted to see him so bad,
that I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.

1314
02:11:57,319 --> 02:11:59,823
Ann kept sending me pictures of him —

1315
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:05,079
until I asked her to stop.

1316
02:12:11,879 --> 02:12:17,697
I couldn't stand the pain of seeing him grow up —
and missing it.

1318
02:12:26,897 --> 02:12:29,524
Why didn't you keep him
with you, Jane?

1319
02:12:32,945 --> 02:12:34,489
I couldn't, Travis.

1320
02:12:39,161 --> 02:12:41,747
I didn't have what I knew he needed.

1321
02:12:48,797 --> 02:12:52,218
I didn't want to use him
to fill all my emptiness.

1322
02:12:57,934 --> 02:12:59,686
Well he needs you now, Jane —

1323
02:13:00,562 --> 02:13:02,022
and he wants to see you.

1324
02:13:02,439 --> 02:13:03,399
He does?

1325
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:07,737
Yes.

1326
02:13:12,785 --> 02:13:14,995
He's waiting for you.

1327
02:13:15,538 --> 02:13:16,497
Where?

1328
02:13:19,876 --> 02:13:24,044
Downtown — in a hotel —

1330
02:13:26,342 --> 02:13:27,510
The Meridian.

1331
02:13:30,179 --> 02:13:32,182
Room #1520.

1331
02:13:37,179 --> 02:13:39,182
<i>#1520.</i>

1332
02:13:39,984 --> 02:13:41,735
You're not going, are you?

1333
02:13:57,587 --> 02:13:59,423
I can't see you, Jane.

1334
02:14:01,967 --> 02:14:03,386
Don't go yet.

1335
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:09,685
<i>Don't go yet.</i>

1336
02:14:28,665 --> 02:14:30,125
I —

1337
02:14:32,712 --> 02:14:36,175
I used to make up long speeches
to you, after you left.

1338
02:14:41,389 --> 02:14:45,558
I used to talk to you all the time —
even though I was alone.

1340
02:14:49,816 --> 02:14:52,401
I walked around for months,
talking to you.

1341
02:14:57,407 --> 02:15:00,161
Now — I don't know what to say.

1342
02:15:04,499 --> 02:15:07,378
It was easier when I just imagined you.

1343
02:15:15,513 --> 02:15:18,057
I even imagined you talking back to me.

1344
02:15:23,063 --> 02:15:29,441
We'd have long conversations —
the two of us.

1346
02:15:32,992 --> 02:15:35,578
It was almost like you were there.

1347
02:15:39,958 --> 02:15:43,461
I would hear you —
I would see you — smell you —

1349
02:15:46,048 --> 02:15:47,676
I could hear your voice.

1350
02:15:51,096 --> 02:15:53,391
Sometimes, your voice would wake me up.

1351
02:15:57,020 --> 02:16:00,816
It would wake me up in the middle of the night,
just like you were there in the room with me.

1352
02:16:09,493 --> 02:16:10,452
Then —

1353
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:16,210
It slowly faded.

1354
02:16:18,338 --> 02:16:20,382
I couldn't picture you anymore.

1355
02:16:24,553 --> 02:16:27,891
I tried to talk out loud to you
like I used to —

1356
02:16:27,891 --> 02:16:29,684
but there was nothing there.

1357
02:16:33,606 --> 02:16:35,525
I couldn't hear you.

1358
02:16:41,323 --> 02:16:42,449
Then —

1359
02:16:48,207 --> 02:16:49,583
I just gave up.

1360
02:16:56,633 --> 02:16:58,260
Everything stopped.

1361
02:17:00,471 --> 02:17:01,514
You —

1362
02:17:06,185 --> 02:17:07,729
just disappeared.

1363
02:17:14,529 --> 02:17:16,489
Now I'm working here.

1364
02:17:22,289 --> 02:17:24,499
I hear your voice all the time.

1365
02:17:30,715 --> 02:17:35,300
Every man —
has your voice.

1367
02:17:54,494 --> 02:17:58,537
I'll tell Hunter that you're coming.

1369
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:03,630
Travis —

1369
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:04,630
What?

1370
02:18:09,135 --> 02:18:10,470
I'll be there.

1371
02:18:15,976 --> 02:18:16,852
<i>Good.</i>

1372
02:18:22,776 --> 02:18:26,321
Meridian Hotel —

1372
02:18:24,776 --> 02:18:26,321
Yeah.

1373
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:34,370
Room #1520.

1375
02:21:23,407 --> 02:21:25,617
Your hair —
it's wet.
