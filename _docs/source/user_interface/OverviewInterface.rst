Overview Interface
==================

If you open a project in VIAN, your interface will look something like the following picture (the picture shows a project already in process, so there are Screenshots, layers in the Timeline etc. If you create a new project, you inerface will look much emptier, but the windows are the same):

   :scale: 50%

   :alt: map to buried treasure

   Overview of the VIAN default interface.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

   OverviewInterface.rst

.. note:: If you dragged some Windows, closed others or are somhow lost in the current interface, you can always come back to this default interface by hitting **ALT-2**.

As you would perform different tasks in your annotating workflow, you would need different widgets and windows to complete them. The VIAN Interface is therefore designed to be as flexible as needed: Different widgets and windows can be closed and opened, re-arranged or even «popped-out» (by dragging the element by its titel bar) of the normal Interface. Below is a short description of the default windows, which are seen in the picture above, and their functionality. If you click on the title you get directed to the more detail sub-page of the window/tool under **Interface in Detail**.

.. Since this is what you will see when you create a new project, the Timeline and Screenshot Manager look (and are) pretty empty. If you want to know what a prototypical procedure in annotating and analyzing a film from this point on would look like, go to XXX. If you want to know more about a specific widget seen above, go to YYY.

1. :ref:`video_player`
***********************

The Video Player shows you the current frame where you are in the **Timeline**. It is also a **Perspective**.

2. :ref:`screenshot_manager`
****************************

The Screenshot Manager let's you manage your screenshots and has several display possibilities of them: In the default view (when the **Screenshots** Tab is highlighted) the screenshots are displayed according to your main **Segmentation Layer**, which means that the Shots are being ordered according to the Segment in which they were taken. The **LA-View** and **LC-View** plot all Screenshots according to their color properties. With the **Plot Controls** you can scale the axes and icons. It is also a **Perspective**.

3. Control Panel
****************

The Control Panel allows you to configure the VIAN interface with the Windows and tools you need for your current task. It indicates active Windows by highlighting them blue. If you closed a window (by accident or because you didn't it for the moment) you can always get it back by clicking the corresponding icon in the control panel (if ou hover the icons, you will see what Window it stands for).

4. :ref:`timeline`
******************

In the timeline you find a lot of useful information: You see an Overview of the different Layers your project has (Segmentation, Annotation), the Screenshots you took, the Luminance and Volume levels of the movie. The red line indicates where in the movie you are, as seen in the **Video Player**.

5. :ref:`player_controls`
************************

The Player Controls is the tool for controling playing of the media, i. e. the movie you are annotating: You can regulate the Volume, play and pause the movie (which can also be done by hitting **Space**, fast for- and backward it, etc. The **Show Slider** Button lets you control by a slider, where in the movie you wanna be (the same funcionality as the red bar in the **Timeline**). Since this a Window that is not always needed, often you can close it to increase the size of other windows (e. g. the **Screenshot Manager** etc.).

6. Current Position in the Workflow
***********************************

In the prototypical case of annotating a movie, there is a series of tasks you have to do sequentially: Setting up the adjustments how and what you want to annotate (specifying for example a vocabulary and and objects you want to classify according to it) --> Split the movie in logically coherent Segemnts (for example according to color features) --> Annotate/Classify these segments (-->) Upload your annotated movie into a/the Database.
