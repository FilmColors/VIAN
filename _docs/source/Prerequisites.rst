Movie Files
***********

Before you start a new Project, consider the following points concerning video format, computational resources etc.:
VIAN handles a wide variety of film codecs and container (file) formats. However consider following important notes regarding the movie file.

- We test VIAN with h264 and h265 encoded .mp4 movies.
- h264 ensures performance of VIAN, however the compression has an impact on the movie quality
- h265 ensures a good quality, may however effect the performance of VIAN depending on your computer
- (detail) Make sure that the compression method does not include skipped frames
- (detail) Movie and audio channel have to have the same length


System Requirements

Depending on the Task and tools one plans to use, VIAN requires different amounts of resources.

Minimal Requirements:

- 5 GB Disc Storage
- 8 GB Ram
- Decent Processor

Recommended Requirements:

- 5 GB Disc Storage
- 16 GB Ram
- Very decent Processor :-)

- Since VIAN computes the colorimetry of each frame of the movie when you start a new project, this process may take some while.
