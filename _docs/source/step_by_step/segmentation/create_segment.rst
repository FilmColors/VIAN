Creating Segments
*****************

There are several ways to create Segments in VIAN, depending on your Use-Case you may choose one of the following:

1. **Time Slice Dragging** allows you to define a start and an end-point of the new segment.
2. **Fast Segmentation** will automatically create a new Segment from the last segments end, to your current time location.
3. **Interval Selection** allows to define a start and an end-point with an infinite number of actions in between.

Time Slice Dragging
*******************

1. In the Timeline, **click** on the name of the Segmentation you want to add a Segment to.
2. The Segmentation should now be highlighted with a steel-blue color.
3. On the *Timeline-Scale*, **Right-Press** and drag (while holding the the Right Button down) from the segment start to the Segment end and **Release**.
4. In the appearing Context Menu, choose **Add Segment**.

.. note:: **Options**

   1. **Name**, how the template should appear in the "New Project Dialog"
   2. **Include**, which entities of your project should be exported.

Fast Segmentation
*****************

1. In the Timeline, **click** on the name of the Segmentation you want to add a Segment to.
2. The Segmentation should now be highlighted with a steel-blue color.
3. On the *Timeline-Scale*, **Right-Click** onto the end Position of your new Segment.
4. In the appearing Context Menu, choose **New Segment**.

.. note::
   Alternatively, one can create a new Segment using the Main Menu by triggering:

   **Create/Add Segment**

.. note::
   **Forward vs. Backward Segmentation**
   By default, VIAN uses a **Backward Segmentation** algorithm when fast-segmenting.
   This means, that the new segment is created from the last Segment's end to the current time.

   Alternatively, you may activate **Forward Segmentation** in the *Timeline/Options* Menu, this means,
   that the new segment is created from the current time to the next Segment's start or the end of the movie,
   cutting the overlapping Segment if existing.
