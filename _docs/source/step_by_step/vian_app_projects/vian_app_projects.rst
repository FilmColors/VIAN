VIAN WebApp Projects
====================

On the home page of `VIAN <https://www.vian.app/projects>`_ you can
find a multitute of already analysed movies. Besides the possibilty
to query and explore those on the site of VIAN directly, you can
also download a project you're interested in and look at it in the
VIAN application itself.

.. note::

   It is important that you are in possession of the **exact** same movie file - otherwise the project that will be re-built in your VIAN locally will be corrupted.

To inspect a project locally in your VIAN application, select the move you are interested in and click `download`.
