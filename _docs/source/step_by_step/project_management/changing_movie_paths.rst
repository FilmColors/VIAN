Changing Movie Paths
********************
There might be occasions where changing the movie path becomes necessary.
For example, when the project has been moved to a different computer and the movie file
is located at a different location, or when the movie file has been changed.

1. In the Outliner, *Right-Click* on the **movie-descriptor** (Indicated with a yellow color).
2. In the appearing ContextMenu, click on **Set Movie Path** and choose the target movie file.
