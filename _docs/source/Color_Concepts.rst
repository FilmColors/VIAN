Color Concepts
==============

In this section, you find an overview over the concepts, that are being used in
VIAN, and what you can read out of the various analyses that VIAN offers.

First of all, it is important to note that all of VIAN's visualizations of
color properties and analyses are in the CIE L*a*b*- (or, simply, Lab-) space.
Sometimes, elements or color properties of them are mapped into a sub-space of
CIE L*a*b* - e.g. in some visualizations, the average color of screenshots may
be displayed on the 2D-plane of their ab-values.

But let's first look at what the CIE L*a*b* space actually is:

CIE L*a*b*
**********

The CIE L*a*b* color space is a way to arrange colors in a intuitively
understandable way:
The three letters **L**, **a**, and **b** stand for the three parameters according to
which the colors are arranged in this color space:

- **L**: The Lightness of the color. The lighter the color, the higher is this
  value. It ranges from 0 (black) to 100 (white).
- **a**: The color on the green-red axis.
- **b**: The color on the blue-yellow axis.
